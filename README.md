# Flight Prediction with EDA and Feature Engineering

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of flight data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering techniques to predict flight delays. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors that impact flight schedules and improve on-time performance. 

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the flight dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform comprehensive EDA to understand the distribution of flight delays, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between variables. Visualize key factors influencing flight delays such as departure time, airline, and airport.

- **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features from the existing dataset or external sources to enhance the predictive power of the model. Engineer features such as historical flight data, weather conditions, and holidays to capture relevant information.

- **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models, such as regression or classification algorithms, to predict flight delays based on the engineered features. Evaluate and fine-tune the models to achieve optimal performance.

- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy and performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Compare different models to identify the most effective approach for flight delay prediction.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the flight dataset, handle missing values, and standardize data formats using appropriate techniques.

2. **EDA**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize flight delays, identify trends, and understand the relationships between variables. Extract insights that will inform feature engineering.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer additional features from the dataset and external sources to capture relevant information that influences flight delays.

4. **Model Development**: Train machine learning models using the engineered features to predict flight delays. Explore different algorithms and evaluate their performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy and performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Fine-tune the models to achieve optimal results.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**: Present the analysis results using charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the key findings and predictive models' performance.
